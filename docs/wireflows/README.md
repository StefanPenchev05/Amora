# Wireflows

This folder contains wireframes and user flow documentation for the Viki application.

## Purpose

Wireflows combine wireframes with user flows to show both the interface design and the navigation paths through the application. They help visualize:

- User journey mapping
- Screen-to-screen navigation
- Interface layout and structure
- Interaction patterns
